TB can affect any organ (extra-pulmonary tuberculosis). It is transmitted from person to person when, for example, an individual with active pulmonary TB coughs or sneezes. The bacteria are inhaled and multiply within macrophages. Most people who inhale M. *tuberculosis* are not infected; about 10% of those infected will develop the disease during their lifetime, with a higher risk among immunocompromised individuals (such as people infected with HIV).\\n\\n\\nMethods\\nThis report is based on data up to 2021 retrieved from The European Surveillance System (TESSy) on 31 December 2022.

In as previous years, a few countries reported a large proportion of the total number of cases, including Romania, which reported almost a quarter (24%) of the total notifications.\\n\\nDespite the slight increase observed for the number of XDR-TB and MDR-TB cases in the EU/EEA in 2021, the overall trend remained stable. The number of TB cases with known drug resistance status was higher than the number of drug-resistant TB cases in the European Region High Priority Countries (HPCs) bordering the EU/EEA. Drug-susceptible TB cases accounted for 89% of all notified TB cases, while MDR-TB and XDR-TB cases accounted for 10% and 1%, respectively.\\n\\nDiscussion\\n\\nTB is a preventable disease that has been eliminated as a public health threat in high-income countries but continues to be a major global health problem. The burden of TB varies widely between high- and low-incidence countries, with the former having a higher incidence rate than the latter. High-incidence countries have a greater number of cases per 100,000 population and a higher proportion of drug-resistant TB cases compared to low-incidence countries.\\n\\nPublic health implications\\n\\nTB is a preventable disease that has been eliminated as a public health threat in high-income countries but continues to be a major global health problem.

TB can affect any organ (extra-pulmonary tuberculosis). It is transmitted from person to person when, for example, an individual with active pulmonary TB coughs or sneezes. The bacteria are inhaled and multiply within macrophages. Most people who inhale M. *tuberculosis* are not infected; about 10% of those infected will develop the disease during their lifetime, with a higher risk among immunocompromised individuals (such as people infected with HIV).\\n\\n\\nMethods\\nThis report is based on data up to 2021 retrieved from The European Surveillance System (TESSy) on 31 December 2022.

All EU/EEA countries except Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland have comprehensive surveillance systems. All countries used the EU case definition for tuberculosis during the reporting period.\\n\\nConfirmed cases required either a positive culture, or both detection of acid-fast bacilli by microscopy and detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC) by nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs).\\n\\nMultidrug resistance (MDR) was defined as resistance to at least isoniazid and rifampicin. Pre-extensive drug resistance (pre-XDR) refers to resistance to: 10 at least rifampicin; (that is, rifampicin/resistance/nonextensive drug-resistant TB (NDR); and/or 2) at least fluoroquinolone (that is, fluoroquinolone/MDR/NDR), or both. Extensive drug resistance refers to resistance to: 1) at least rifampicin (that is, rifampicin/resistance/multidrug-resistant TB (MDR)), and/or 2) at least fluoroquinolone (that is, fluoroquinolone/MDR/NDR), or both.\\n\\nForeign origin refers in cases born in (or citizens of a country different to the reporting country\\n\\nEpidemiology\\nIn 2021, 37,954 TB cases were reported by all EU/EEA countries. Ten countries reported 88.3% of the total cases, with Romania alone accounting for 23.3% of all TB cases reported in 2021 (Table 1). The rate of notified cases per 100,000 population decreased from 45.7 in 2020 to 43.6 in 2021.\\n\\nTable 1: Distribution of tuberculosis cases and rates per 100,000 population by country and year,\\nEU/EEA, 2017–2021\\n```\\n\\n## Page 3\\n\\n| Country | 2017 | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 |\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n| Number | Rate | Number | Rate | Number | Rate | Number | Rate | Number | Rate |\\n| Italy | 3 946 | 8.5 | 3 912 | 8.5 | 3 740 | 5.8 | 2 287 | 3.8 | 1 860 | 4.2 | 4.3 |\\n| Netherlands | 783 | 4.6 | 795 | 4.6 | 754 | 4.4 | 422 | 3.6 | 660 | 3.9 | 4.0 |\\n| Latvia | 152 | 28.3 | NRC | NRC | NRC | NRC | NRC | NRC | 261 | 13.8 | 13.4 |\\n| Liechtenstein | 1 | 2.6 | 1 | 2.6 | NRC | NRC | 2 | 5.2 | 1 | 2.6 | 2.1 |\\n| Lithuania | 1 387 | 48.7 | 1 142 | 40.7 | 1 058 | 37.9 | 726 | 26.0 | 646 | 23.1 | 22.3 |\\n| Luxembourg | 32 | 5.4 | 42 | 7.0 | 50 | 8.3 | 34 | 5.4 | 35 | 5.5 | 5.6 |\\n| Malta | 42 | 9.1 | 55 | 11.6 | 98 | 19.9 | 140 | 27.2 | 54 | 10.5 | 11.1 |\\n| Norway | 35 | 18.6 | NRC | NRC | 139 | 7.3 | 139 | 7.3 | 139 | 7.3 | 7.4 |\\n| Poland | 5 787 | 15.2 | 5 407 | 14.4 | 5 321 | 14.0 | 3 386 | 8.9 | 3 704 | 9.8 | 9.5 |\\n| Portugal | 1 914 | 18.6 | 1 926 | 18.7 | 1 907 | 18.6 | 1 519 | 14.8 | 1 504 | 14.6 | 13.9 |\\n| Romania | 12 997 | 60.2 | 12 199 | 62.5 | 11 618 | 59.8 | 7 403 | 39.8 | 7 979 | 41.6 | 40.5 |\\n| Slovakia | 249 | 4.6 | 281 | 5.2 | 214 | 3.9 | 158 | 2.9 | 137 | 2.5 | 2.6 |\\n| Slovenia | 112 | 5.4 | 99 | 4.8 | 103 | 4.9 | 77 | 3.7 | 80 | 3.8 | 3.5 |\\n| Spain | 5 660 | 12.2 | 4 766 | 10.2 | 4 552 | 9.7 | 3 607 | 7.8 | 3 508 | 7.4 | 7.3 |\\n| Sweden | 22 | 0.2 | 48 | 0.8 | 419 | 4.7 | 324 | 3.1 | 307 | 3.4 | 3.6 |\\n| EU-EEA | 50 854 | 13.3 | 47 684 | 10.6 | 45 492 | 10.0 | 33 895 | 7.5 | 30 527 | 7.4 | 7.6 |\\n| Source: Country reports | | | | | | | | | | | |\\n| ADR: age-standardized rate | | | | | | | | | | | |\\n| NRC: no data reported | | | | | | | | | | |\\n\\n## Page 4\\n\\nFigure 1.

Previously treated cases was 10% or above in eight countries: Bulgaria (18.3%), Estonia (15.1%), Hungary (12.9%), Latvia (11.7%), Lithuania (11.6%), Poland (10.4%), Romania (10.3%) and Slovakia (10.2%).\\n\\nAmong TB cases reported in 2021, 24133 (75.2%) were laboratory-confirmed. Of these cases, 17897 (74.7%) had both culture-positive and nucleic acid test positive (but culture negative), and 5794 (24.6%) cases were culture, sputum; and nucleic acid test positive. Of all TB cases reported in 2021, 38% were extra-pulmonary disease: 10251 (32.7%) with pulmonary TB, 17239 (55.3%) with extra-pulmonary TB, 2254 (6.9%) with a combination of both, and 205 (0.6%) had no TB site reported.\\n\\nAge and gender\\n\\nIn 2021, the highest notification rate was observed in the 25 to 44 years age group (9.4 per 100 000 population). Overall, the rate in males was twice the rate in females, but this imbalance was limited to age groups above 34 years (Figure 2).\\n\\n\\n## Page 5\\n\\n```markdown\\nSURVEILLANCE REPORT\\n\\nAnnual epidemiological report for 2021\\n\\n\\nFigure 2.

Of these, 895 (5.4%) had rifampicin resistance/non-resistance. In 2021, the proportion of TB cases with rifampicin resistance or with resistance to multiple anti-TB drugs was similar to that in 2020 (rifampicin resistance: 3% vs 3%, and multi-drug resistance: 5% vs 4%). The proportion of TB cases with both was 1%.\\n\\nIn total, 8.4% of EU/EEA TB cases had drug-susceptibility testing results for any fluoroquinolone. Among these, 115 (28.9%) met the definition for pre-XDR. The majority (67.8%, 79 of 115) of pre-XDR cases had drug-susceptibility testing results available for both rifampicin and isoniazid. The proportion increased in 2021 from 45.1% to 37 in 2020), but the numbers reported remain low overall.\\n```\\n\\n## Page 6\\n\\n```markdown\\nHIV co-infection\\n\\nHIV status was recorded for 12 (77.96%) of the 15 TB cases from the 21 countries that reported the HIV status of TB cases. Of cases with known HIV status, 47/12 (38.3%) were reported as HIV positive. There were 17 counties with at least one case reporting a known HIV status. The proportion of co-infected cases was highest in Estonia (11.1%), Hungary (14.6%), and Latvia (11.1%). The proportion of co-infected cases with TB and HIV infection peaked at 21.3% in 2018 and 2017, decreased to 21.3% in 2016, and dropped again to 19.5% in 2019 and 2020.\\n\\nTreatment outcome\\n\\nIn 2021, all EU/EEA countries reported TB notification data, with a total of 35,727 TB cases.

The disease most frequently presents an acute, febrile illness with myalgia, skin rash, arthralgia, and neurological signs. Subclinical and asymptomatic infections are also common. Laboratory confirmation of ZIKV infection is achieved through serological evidence or molecular detection of the virus in blood or other clinical specimens.\\n\\n### Methods\\nThis report is based on data for 2021 retrieved from The European Surveillance System (TESSy) on 25 October 2022. TESSy is a system for the collection, analysis, and dissemination of data on communicable diseases.\\nFor a detailed description of the methods used in this report, refer to the \"Methods\" chapter in the \\'Introduction\\' to the Annual Epidemiological Report [4].\\n\\nA more comprehensive list of references can be found online [2].\\nA subset of the data used for this report is available through ECDC\\'s online \\'Surveillance Atlas of Infectious Diseases\\' (1).\\n\\n\\n### References\\n[1] European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.
